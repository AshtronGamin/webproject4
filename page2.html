<!-- 
This page explains WHY we're building Naawi-Oodena and HOW we're doing it.
First section's about fixing history and building a better future.
Second one's all about the process — making it eco and done by the community.
We used Flexbox to make the two boxes sit side by side and look nice.

    <h2>Why We Are Building It</h2>
    <p>Naawi-Oodena is being built to restore land, culture, and community. 
        It represents a historic agreement between Indigenous nations and
        the Government of Canada to return control of a significant urban space. This development serves as a symbol of reconciliation, 
        resilience, and renewal—providing housing, economic opportunity, and cultural revitalization in the heart of Winnipeg.</p>

    <h2>How We Are Building It</h2>
    <p>Naawi-Oodena is being built through a collaborative, community-led process. 
        Planning is directed by Indigenous leadership and guided by values like sustainability, accessibility, and cultural inclusion. 
        The design prioritizes walkability, environmental protection, and mixed-use development, 
        blending residential, recreational, and educational spaces. 
        Every step—from naming streets to selecting building materials—is rooted in respect for people and land.</p>
