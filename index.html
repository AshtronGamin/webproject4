            <h2>Where Is It Built</h2>
    <p>Naawi Oodena is located on the gentle edge of the Whispering Valley,
        just north of the serene River Kweyetun. Surrounded by old-growth forest and rolling hills, 
        the neighborhood is about 15 minutes from the nearest town center but feels like a world of its own. 
        The land it was built on holds deep cultural and spiritual significance, 
        once used as a seasonal gathering place for storytelling, healing, and celebration. 
        Its name, meaning "the center of the four winds" in an old local dialect, reflects its role as a meeting place for people, 
        cultures, and ideas. Well-connected by sustainable transit routes and walking trails,
        Naawi Oodena is both peaceful and accessible.</p>

        <h2>Why We Made It</h2>

        We aimed to create a neighborhood that reflects harmony, inclusion, and sustainability. 
        By blending traditional values with modern living, we sought to offer something unique and meaningful.
