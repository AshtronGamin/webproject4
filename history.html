<h1>The Story of Naawi-Oodena</h1>

<main class="accordion-wrapper">

<details>
    <summary>Before Development</summary>
    <p>Long before Naawi-Oodena became a community in progress, the land held deep cultural and spiritual meaning.
        Indigenous peoples gathered here for generations to share stories, offer prayers, and connect with nature. 
        The land was more than a location—it was a living memory and part of identity.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Displacement and Disruption</summary>
    <p>During the colonial era, the land was repurposed and transformed for military use. 
        Its original caretakers were displaced, and ceremonies were halted. Yet, 
        the knowledge and memories tied to this place endured through oral tradition, family teachings, and spiritual connection.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Reclamation and Justice</summary>
    <p>Through decades of advocacy, communities fought to reclaim what was lost. After persistent legal battles and public action, 
        the land was rightfully returned to Indigenous stewardship. The reclamation was not only political—it was emotional, symbolic, 
        and empowering.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Building the Future</summary>
    <p>Naawi-Oodena is being reimagined as a place of balance: where tradition and innovation coexist. 
        It is a beacon of sustainability, community, and cultural resurgence. With walkable design, green space, 
        and shared governance, it honors the past while embracing the future.</p>
